My name is **Andy**!, currently I'm a first year college student.
I am enrolled @ Champlain College, joining the class of 2027. I am pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science.

## Interests and Hobbies
* <mark>Watches.</mark>
* <mark>Compiler design.</mark>
* <mark>Operating systems design.</mark>
* <mark>Open source programming.</mark>

I really enjoy topics relating to *lower-level* programming. If I was forced to pick a single interest, it would be **Compiler Design**.
Something about creating and designing a compiler is so captivating to me, it's an iterative proccesses and it demands attention from the programmer.

## Plans for the future.
I am currently doing classes, etc. I do hope to start interning/working soon. I am also working on personal projects in my own time.
